/**
 * An objective defines what the player must attempt to solve.   It is expressed
 * in terms of two parts:
 *
 * --------------------
 * PART ONE
 * --------------------
 *
 * A String of `4*N` characters, where `N` is the number of directly connected island pairs.
 *
 * There are ten islands in the game, marked as (*) in the following board layout:
 *
 *  X 0    1    2    3    4
 * Y
 * 0  (*)--|---(*)---|--(*)
 *    |    |    |    |    |
 * 1  |---(*)---|---(*)---|
 *    |    |    |    |    |
 * 2  (*)--|---(*)---|--(*)
 *    |    |    |    |    |
 * 3  |---(*)---|---(*)---|
 *
 * Each island is addressed by its X and Y offsets.
 *
 * A direct connection between island(i) and island(j) is encoded with 4 characters as follows:
 *
 * [0] = X offset of island(i)
 * [1] = Y offset of island(i)
 * [2] = X offset of island(j)
 * [3] = Y offset of island(j)
 *
 * For example, the "001110111102" objective string represents that:
 * - the islands at (0,0) and (1,1) must be connected, and
 * - the islands at (1,0) and (1,1) must be connected, and
 * - the islands at (1,1) and (0,2) must be connected, and
 * - all other pairs of islands must not be directly connected.
 *
 * The above objective string leads to this board layout:
 *
 *     X 0    1    2    3    4
 *   Y
 *   0  (*)--|---(*)---|--(*)
 *      | (+)|(+) |    |    |
 *   1  |---(*)---|---(*)---|
 *      | (+)|    |    |    |
 *   2  (*)--|---(*)---|--(*)
 *      |    |    |    |    |
 *   3  |---(*)---|---(*)---|
 *
 * where a `*` represents an island and a `+` represents a direct path between two islands.
 *
 *--------------------
 * PART TWO
 *--------------------
 *
 * A String of `4*M` characters, where `M` is the number of pieces already placed on the
 * board when the game starts.
 *
 * A placement consists of 4 characters encoded as:
 *
 * [0] = The piece ID {'a' to 'f'}
 * [1] = The x coordinate of the top left corner of the tile {'0' to '3'}
 * [2] = The y coordinate of the top left corner of the tile {'0' to '2'}
 * [3] = the orientation of the piece {'N'=NORTH, 'E'=EAST, 'S'=SOUTH and 'W'=WEST}
 *
 *
 * For example, the string "axyN" means that piece 'a' is placed with its top-left
 * corner at location (x, y), and is oriented NORTH.
 *
 * Note that for all objectives, there should not be any paths between dinosaurs
 * with different colors.
